pywer and :mod:`libaur` documentation
=====================================

pywer is a python interface to the `Arch Linux AUR`_. While the defaults
make it work with ``https://aur.archlinux.org/``, it can also be used with any
website using the AUR software. It requires `requests`_, `pyxdg`_, and
`pyalpm`_ [1]_.

While you can use the ``pywer`` script to easily search, introspect or
update from a terminal, there is also an interface provided in :mod:`libaur`
for use in your own python programs. It uses python3, though I will accept
patches for compatability with python2.7+.

.. [1] We only require pyalpm for the use of vercmp. If you have some other
       way of comparing versions that is the same as that of pacman but
       written in python, or a way to use just pyalpm, please send in a
       patch. There is a ``libaur.vercmp`` branch to this repository that
       contains tests for a vercmp system.
