pywer: A simple library based AUR helper
========================================

Based on python, this project was started on a whim to provide a python
interface to the AUR, and also to emulate cower_ in its options and output.
I'm still working on the latter, but it's getting there.

It also includes a library, `libaur`, that can be imported for use in your
scripts.
