'''
Simple Arch Linux PKGBUILD parsing to get basic declarations. Also does basic
substitution for official variables (ie, pkgname, pkgver, etc). Does not do
positional replacement.

    '''
    Does EXTREMELY BASIC parsing of a PKGBUILD. Only has very basic
    capabilities, and is mostly for finding variables. Also does simple
    substidution of non-bash-array variables.

    Each value is an array with the values, even for those that can only take a
    single string value.

    Arguments:
    path -- path to a PKGBUILD file
    full_str -- a single string containing the whole PKGBUILD file

    Returns:
    Dictionary
