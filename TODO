Release notes

I mentioned the new features, and I will be working on this more. Here's
the things I still need to add:

pywer
- option flags for overriding certain things such as ignored repos.
- look through the cower man page. We have a lot of options to add, some
  of which may not be easy. So far I've only gotten the main operations
  in there. (see cower.1 for more info)

  sphinx or something with more info on the library and its use

- Flags for colors (see 'pywer')
